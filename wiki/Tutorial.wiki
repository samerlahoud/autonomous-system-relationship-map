#How to Draw an Autonomous System Relationship Map

= Introduction =
This project aims to provide a tool for drawing relationship maps between Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet. 

Autonomous Systems can have three types of relationships as introduced by [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=504616 L. Gao]:     
  * customer-to-provider (c2p) (or if looked at from the opposite direction, provider-to-customer p2c),
  * peer-to-peer (p2p), and
  * sibling-to-sibling (s2s) 

=Data Collection=
The software tool uses public data collection provided by [http://www.caida.org/home/ CAIDA] :
  * [http://as-rank.caida.org/?mode0=as-dump-info AS information]
  * [http://as-rank.caida.org/?mode0=as-dump-peercones Relationship data]
  * [http://www.caida.org/data/request_user_info_forms/as_relationships.xml AS name to number mapping]
